    <p> I am a 3rd semester student majoring in Informatics Engineering who has great interests and aspirations in the fields of web development and UI/UX design. 
        Even though I am still in the learning stage and feel that I have not fully mastered these two fields, I am very enthusiastic about continuing to explore knowledge and hone my skills so that I can realize my dream of becoming a professional in the world of technology.
        As an introvert, I prefer to work in a quiet atmosphere and think deeply about solutions. 
        Although I sometimes feel more comfortable alone, I always try to be open and learn from experiences and collaboration with others, especially in a very dynamic world like web development and interface design.
        I'm also interested in exploring how technology can provide a better and more intuitive experience for users. 
        Therefore, I wanted to dive deeper into interface design and user experience (UI/UX), in addition to technical skills in web development. 
        In the future, I hope to continue to develop and pursue a career in web development or UI/UX design, and to be able to contribute to projects that prioritize a pleasant and functional user experience.</p>
